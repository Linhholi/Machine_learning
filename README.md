10 Must-Know Machine Learning Algorithms for Data Scientists. The idea comes from https://medium.com/@johnvastola/10-must-know-machine-learning-algorithms-for-data-scientists-adbf3272398a

There are 3 types of ML Algorithms which are 
- supervised (Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Linear/kernel SVM), 
- unsupervised (KNN, Clustering, DBSCAN, SVD, and Latent Dirichlet Analysis), 
- and reinforcement learning (Monte Carlo, Markow Decision Processes, and Q-learning). 

In this repository, 10 algorithms are mentioned  will be introduced.

1. Superivised ML steps:

Step 1: Load data
Step 2: View data infor to check any missing, impossible or human errors cells
Step 3: Cleaning dataset based on finding from step 2
Step 4: Visualize each column if needed
Step 5: Create dummies data if there are some columns that are not integers
Step 6: Split the data into training and testing sets
Step 7: Import necessary libraries from sk_learn
Step 8: Fit the training set and create prediction variable.
Step 9: Visualize results (confusion matrix)
