13 Must-Know Machine Learning Algorithms for Data Scientists. The idea comes from https://medium.com/@johnvastola/10-must-know-machine-learning-algorithms-for-data-scientists-adbf3272398a

There are 3 types of ML Algorithms which are 
- supervised (Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, and Linear/kernel SVM) (Dataset source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
- unsupervised (KNN, Clustering, DBSCAN, SVD, and Latent Dirichlet Analysis) (Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data)
- and reinforcement learning (Monte Carlo, Markow Decision Processes, and Q-learning). 

In this repository, 10 algorithms are mentioned  will be introduced.
